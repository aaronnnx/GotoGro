# GotoGro (SWE20001 Managing Software Projects Gotogro Project) 

This project is the effort of students of INTI International College Subang Jaya SWE20001 Managing Software Projects Group 8 AUG2022. Group members are Aaron Tung Xingron, Khoo Chee Seng Adrian, Ong Ai Fei, Hayes Warren Lum, Lim Eng Hyen.

Goto Grocery (GotoGro) Inc. is a member-based grocery store based in Hawthron, which ensures their members with quality and fresh groceries. They are facing issues on member record management due to their current paper-based system. On the other hand, they are also facing difficulties on satisifying their members' needs. 

Therefore, this project is created with the initiative to help Goto Grocery (GotoGro) Inc. to solve their issues on member record management and notifications on member's grocery needs in a timely manner. This system should have a graphical user interface and reports generated should be in a format that can be easily translated to CSV (comma seperated values) files for further processing. 

This project is mainly targeted for 3 users (staff, supervisor, and manager), and it has a total of 14 backlog items. Each member are restricted to only perform actions according to their authority level.
